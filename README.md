## Build

### Prerequisites

#### Java

Install Java8 (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java8.html).
If you want to build the master branch you will need a Java JDK of minimum version 8.

#### Maven

Install the build tool [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

You need to ensure that Maven uses the Java JDK needed for the branch you want to build.

To do so execute

```bash
mvn -version
```

which will tell you what version Maven is using. Refer to the [Maven docs](https://maven.apache.org/configure.html) if you need to configure Maven.

#### Git

Install the version control tool [git]https://github.com/wawa/) and clone this repository with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core.git
```

### Build Command

After you have taken care of the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

Execute the following

```bash
cd openmrs-core
mvn clean package
```

This will generate the OpenMRS application in `webapp/target/openmrs.war` which you will have to deploy into an application server like for example [tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/) or [jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/).

### Deploy

For development purposes you can simply deploy the `openmrs.war` into the application server jetty via

```bash
cd openmrs-core/webapp
mvn jetty:run
```

If all goes well (check the console output) you can access the OpenMRS application at `localhost:8080/openmrs`.

Refer to [Getting Started as a Developer - Maven](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Maven) for some more information
on useful Maven commands and build options.
